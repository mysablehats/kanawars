Kana Wars README

This is a simple game in python using pygame to train kana input. 

The idea behind it is to train typing kanas as they are, instead of always resorting to romaji conversion. I believe this will train understanding kanas as a unit.

There are still major flaws in functionality, since I had to create an input system myself and I am aware it is very crude. I intend to fix it as the project evolves.


1. Installation

The code is currently very simple, so just copy it and everything should work. The whole project however is rather big due to the sizes of the fonts needed to properly render japanese letters. 

I assume you will need python and pygame installed on your pc (those are not here).

Tested on debian linux and windows 7 64 bit and it is working alright. You need both python 2.7 and pygame available at

https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.10/python-2.7.10.msi

and

http://pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.9.2a0.win32-py2.7.msi

But other versions will like work too.

2. Copyrights and Other

This is very anambitious project so everything I did here is free. Probably nobody besides myself will ever know about it.

But I built on the work of others and they might have a problem with it.  Just in case it comes to this: both fonts (cyberbit and japanese gothic) are free, so it should be ok to use them. I used a lot of sample code from others (mostly from pygame page itself) and art from google, only slightly modified with gimp (lower resolution, change alpha layer, that sort of stuff). I
