Kana Wars README

This is a simple game in python using pygame to train kana input. 

The idea behind it is to train typing kanas as they are, instead of always resorting to romaji conversion. I believe this will train understanding kanas as a unit.

There are still major flaws in functionality, since I had to create an input system myself and I am aware it is very crude. I intend to fix it as the project evolves.


1. Installation

The code is currently very simple, so just copy it and everything should work. The whole project however is rather big due to the sizes of the fonts needed to properly render japanese letters. 

I assume you will need python and pygame installed on your pc (those are not here).

I've only tested this on my machine with Debian Linux, so there might be some issues with running it on Windows.

2. Other

Both fonts (cyberbit and japanese gothic) are free, so it should be ok to use them.
